# Creating Cloud Foundry apps
{: #creating_cloud_foundry_apps}

With {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, you can create your app in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console. Then, you can decide to continue to use the console, use the cf command line interface, or use {{site.data.keyword.jazzhub_title}} to develop, track, plan, and deploy your app.
{:shortdesc}

When you create an app in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can begin with a starter. A *starter* is a template that includes predefined services and application code that is configured with a particular buildpack.

A *runtime* is the set of resources that is used to run an application. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides runtime environments as containers for different types of applications. The runtime environments are integrated as buildpacks into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, are automatically configured for use, and require little to no maintenance.

To get started creating your application, take the following steps:
  1. Click **Catalog** in the IBM Cloud toolbar.
  2. Click **Cloud Foundry Apps** and choose the **Cloud Foundry** tile. Follow **Public Applications** to select a Region, Runtime, Name, etc. Click **Create**.
  3. When you are finished with the **Getting Started** guide, click **Overview**.
  5. You can add a service to your app by clicking **Create connection** on the app Overview in the dashboard. Or, you can use the cf command line interface. See Options for working with apps.
  6. On the Overview page, scroll to the "Continuous delivery" card and click **View toolchain**. Your app's source will be saved in a repo that is hosted on IBM Cloud. An open toolchain that uses that repo and a delivery pipeline to develop and deploy your app is also created. For more information about the Continuous Delivery service, see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-getting-started#cd_getting_started">Getting started with Continuous Delivery</a>.

**Note:** If a service that you bind to an app crashes, the app might stop running or have errors. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} does not automatically restart the app to recover from these problems. Consider coding your app to identify and recover from outages, exceptions, and connection failures. See the Apps are not automatically restarted troubleshooting topic for more information.

## Options for working with apps

After your app is created, you have a few options for continuing to add services to your app and to build and deploy your app:

<dl>
<dt>cf command line interface</dt>
<dd>Use the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#getting-started">cf command line interface</a> to update your application, create a service instance, or bind the service to your application. You can also use the cloud-cli command line interface to create, update, and delete service offerings.</dd>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} user interface</dt>
<dd>Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/resources">user interface</a> to build your application, including picking which services and runtimes to combine to solve your business problem.</dd>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}</dt>
<dd>Use {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} to automate builds, unit tests, deployments, and more. Edit and push code through the rich web based IDE. Create toolchains to enable tool integrations that support your development, deployment, and operation tasks. The Continuous Delivery service includes Delivery Pipeline, Eclipse Orion Web IDE, and Git Repos and Issue Tracking. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-getting-started#cd_getting_started">Getting started with Continuous Delivery</a>.</dd>
<dt>Adding metrics for monitoring using SysDig</dt>
<dd>CF applications can configure and expose metrics that can be monitored using SysDig. For more information, see [Getting started with Continuous Delivery](/docs/observability-monitoring?topic=observability-monitoring-cloud-foundry-app-metrics).</dd>
</dl>

## Tips

Use the following tips while developing your web apps:

<dl>
<dt>Persistence</dt>
<dd>Don't specify any local storage for your applications. Each instance of your application, even if only one instance is running, can be restarted or moved to a different virtual machine at any time, typically for load balancing. Anything stored in local storage is erased when the application is moved or deleted. Use one of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data store services for persistence.</dd>
<dt>Resource limits</dt>
<dd>Be aware of limits on the quantities of resources that a trial account can use. The limits are as follows:
<table style="width:100%">
<caption>Table 1. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource limits for a trial account</caption>
  <th>Resource type</th>
  <th>Quantity limit</th>
<tr>
  <td>Number of services that are used across all apps</td>
  <td>10</td>
<tr>
  <td>Memory used across all apps</td>
  <td>	2 G</td>
<tr>
  <td>Number of routes</td>
  <td>500</td>
</table>
</dd>
