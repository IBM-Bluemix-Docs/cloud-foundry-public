# Roles and responsibilities
{: #rolesresponsibilities}

If you deploy an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full}} for your organization you will also identify the people in your organization that will take care of administrative and operational tasks or decide to leave the majority of these tasks to {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} via the {{site.data.keyword.cfee_short}} managed service. This page gives an overview on roles and responsibilities surrounding an {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full}}.
