# cloud-foundry
Upstream repo for Cloud Foundry (Public) docs

**Note:** This repo is replacing the draft branches of `cloud-docs/cloud-foundry` and `cloud-docs/cloud-foundry-public` repos which will be deprecated after all source material is moved and restructured.  Effective 7/15/2020 Cloud Foundry Enterprise (`cloud-docs/cloud-foundry`) is deprecated.  Only Cloud Foundry Public (`cloud-docs/cloud-foundry-public`) will continued to be supported and this repo is the "upstream repo" for that publishing repo.

Within this repo are several folders with `CFEE` in their name.  These contain unique CFEE source files from the original `cloud-docs/cloud-foundry` draft branch and are being maintained here should they be needed at some point for CFP.
