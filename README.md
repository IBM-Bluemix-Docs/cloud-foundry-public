# cloud-foundry-public
Publishing repo for Cloud Foundry (Public) docs

**Note:** All SOURCE updates need to be made to `alchemy-writers/cloud-foundry`.  This repo is populated by automation from that repo.  Changes should not be made directly to this repo.

Topics in `draft` are published to `test.cloud.ibm.com`.  Topics in `publish` are externally published to `cloud.ibm.com`.

Effective 7/15/2020 Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment (`cloud-docs/cloud-foundry`) is deprecated.  Only Cloud Foundry Public (`cloud-docs/cloud-foundry-public`) will continued to be published.  All topics that were previously linked from CFEE are now incorporated into the CFP source repository (`alchemy-writers/cloud-foundry`).
