# About Cloud Foundry
{: #about-cf}


## What is Cloud Foundry?
{: #what-is-cloud-foundry}


Cloud Foundry is the premier industry standard Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), that ensures the fastest, easiest, and most reliable deployment of cloud-native applications. Cloud Foundry ensures that the build and deploy aspects of coding remain carefully coordinated with any attached services â€” resulting in quick, consistent and reliable iterating of applications.


## Key Benefits of Cloud Foundry
{: #key-benefits-of-cloud-foundry}

**Choose your own language** - IBM Cloud Foundry includes runtimes for Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift and Go; plus, Cloud Foundry community build packs are also available. Combined with DevOps services, the application runtimes enable a delivery pipeline that automates much of the iterative development process.

**Fault tolerant** - Runtimes facilitate developing applications as stateless processes that quickly: start and stop, replicate if an instance fails, and duplicate if sustained or increased performance requires.

**Extend apps with services** - Runtimes link IBM Cloud services to applications as endpoints, giving any instance of an application embedded knowledge of how to manage relevant calls and data. In fact, runtimes manage all linked resources this way: SDKs, APIs (whether made available as cloud services or exposed from within a traditional enterprise as custom services), and also applications themselves when used as resources by other applications.

**Access Control** - Fine grain assignment/dispensing of compute capacity to development teams.

**Automatic Placement** - Applications are automatically placed across multiple data-center PODs for maximum reliability.

**Automatic Health Management** - Crashing applications will restart automatically.

**Automatic Routing** - Internet reachable routes are automatically created for your applications.

**High Availaibility** - Supports full high avaialbility for extremely high application avaialbility

**Automatic Deployment scaling** - The Auto-Scaling for IBM Cloud service enables you to automatically increase or decrease the compute capacity of your application, to rapidly adjust to dynamic loading needs.
