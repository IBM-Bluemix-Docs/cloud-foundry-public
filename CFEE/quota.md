# Determine the quota for an organization
{: #determinequota}

When you create an organization in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you provision infrastructure resources that include resources such as memory, maximum number of service instances, and maximum number of routes. The quota that is allocated to an organization represents the resources that are available within the organization. You manage the quota and you decide how the resources are distributed across the organization. You set the organization's quota when you create the organization. You can also change that quota anytime from the organization's overview page. The actual capacity of the organization is bound by the total physical capacity of the environment as determined by the number of Diego cells that power that environment.

With Shared and Dedicated, you can increase the number of Diego cells for the environment. You are responsible for providing any resources that might be required to run your business in this environment.
