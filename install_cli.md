# Download, modify, and redeploy your Cloud Foundry app with the command-line interface
{: #cf-deploy-cli}



Use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} command-line interface (CLI) to download, modify, and redeploy your Cloud Foundry applications and service instances.
{: shortdesc}

Before you begin, [download and install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).


After you install the CLI, you can get started:

  1. Change to the directory where your code is located.

  <pre class="pre"><code class="hljs">cd <var class="keyword varname">your_new_directory</var></code></pre>

  2.  Make changes to your app code as you see fit. For example, if you are using an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} sample application and your app contains the `src/main/webapp/index.html` file, you can modify it and edit "Thanks for creating ..." to say something new. Ensure the app runs locally before you deploy it back to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

    Take note of the `manifest.yml` file. When deploying your app back to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, this file is used to determine your applicationâ€™s URL, memory allocation, number of instances, and other crucial parameters. You can [read more about the manifest file](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html){: external} in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

    Also pay attention to the `README.md` file, which contains details such as build instructions if applicable.

    Note: If your application is a Liberty app, you must build it before redeploying.

  3. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with your IBMid. If you have multiple accounts, you are prompted to select which account to use. If you do not specify a region with the `-r` flag, you must also select a region.
  ```
  ibmcloud login
  ```
  {: pre}

  If your credentials are rejected, you might be using a federated ID. To log in with a federated ID, use the `--sso` flag. See [Logging in with a federated ID](/docs/account?topic=account-federated_id) for more details.
  {: tip}

  4. To access Cloud Foundry services, you must specify a Cloud Foundry org and space. You can run the following command to interactively identify the org and space:
  ```
  ibmcloud target --cf
  ```
  {: pre}

  Or, if you know which org and space that the service belongs to, you can use the following command:
  ```
  ibmcloud target -o <value> -s <value>
  ```
  {: pre}

   5. From `your_new_directory`, redeploy your app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using the `ibmcloud cf push` command. For more information, see [`ibmcloud cf push`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_apps#ibmcloud_app_push).

  6. Access your app by browsing to the app URL.
