# Structural overview
{: #patterns}

For a successful project, take time to plan and design which resources you need and what your enterprise requirements are. To help you get started, consider the following questions:
{:shortdesc}

* How many, and what type of, apps are you developing?
* Which services do the apps need to access?
* Who collaborates in the development process and what role do they play?
* What degree of isolation is required for each phase of the project?
* Does your enterprise supply the infrastructure resources?
* How does your company communicate?
* Is there a naming standard that you can implement to clearly identify the organization and space usage?

As part of deciding which type of cloud environment you need, plan the structure of your account, organizations, spaces, resources, and team members.

For most companies, a single {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account is sufficient. For larger companies where there is more than one business area, you might want a separate {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account for each business domain. For example, within a large banking corporation, there can be separate accounts for the retail and commercial sectors.

The following table provides a summary of some of the key elements.

| Element   | Description |
|-----------|---------------|
|| Contains one or more organizations. You must have a Pay-As-You-Go account to create more than one organization. |
|| Can own only one account. |
|| Can add one or more organization managers to delegate the org management, which includes the read and write permissions to the organizations. |
|| Can be a team member in organizations and spaces in other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} accounts. |
| Organization   | Contains one or more spaces. |
