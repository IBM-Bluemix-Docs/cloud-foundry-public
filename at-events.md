# Activity Tracker events
{: #at-events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact with Cloud Foundry Public.
{: shortdesc}

Activity Tracker records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. 

The following Activity Tracker service is available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. Cloud Foundry Public sends events to this service that can be used to monitor Cloud Foundry Public activity in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 

For more information, see:
* [{{site.data.keyword.at_full}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started#getting-started)


## List of events
{: #at-actions}

The events that are generated by Cloud Foundry applications to {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} are listed in the response area of the `GET /v2/events`, under the body section. The *Type* field lists all actions that generate an event. For more information, see [Events API ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/11.2.0/events/list_all_events.html){:new_window}.

## Viewing events
{: #at-ui}

You can view the Activity Tracker events that are associated with your Cloud Foundry app by using [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-getting-started#getting-started). 


### Using {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}
{: #at-ui-logdna}


Events that are generated by a Cloud Foundry app are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location. This means that audit logs of a Cloud Foundry app in `Dallas` are sent to a LogDNA instance in `Dallas`.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-launch#launch_step2).

Audit logs for Cloud Foundry Apps in `Washington DC` are sent to a LogDNA instance in `Dallas`.
